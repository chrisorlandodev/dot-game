# DotGame

Implementation of the DotGame game engine to be used with a front-end client.

#### The Game
A connect-the-dots game for two players.

##### Definitions
octilinear line - a horizontal, vertical, or 45Â° diagonal line

##### Rules
* The game is played on a 4x4 grid of 16 nodes.
* Players take turns drawing octilinear lines connecting nodes.
* Each line must begin at the start or end of the existing path, so that all lines form a continuous path.
* The first line may begin on any node.
* A line may connect any number of nodes.
* Lines may not intersect.
* No node can be visited twice.
* The game ends when no valid lines can be drawn.
* The player who draws the last line is the loser.
